## Order handleing system development

### The Task
In our company the organisation of the orders was very caotic in the past. I got the task to make an application for our ordering system. I don't have all the nessesary rules. So I start developing the program and leave notifications in the commit section from the progress.

### The Versions
  1. Version 1.0
      -Contain basics options for ordering:
        - If the payment is for a physical product, generate a packing slip for shipping.
        - If the payment is for a book, create a duplicate packing slip for the royalty department.
        - If the payment is for a physical product or a book, generate a commission payment to the agent.
  2. Version 1.1
        - If the payment is for a membership, activate that membership.
        - If the payment is an upgrade to a membership, apply the upgrade.
        - If the payment is for a membership or upgrade, e-mail the owner and inform them of the activation/upgrade.
  3. Version 1.2
        - If the packing was succesful, send an email for the client.
        - If the payment was sucessful, but we dont have the specific item in the storage, send an email to the client.
        - Send emails for our members about our new goods.
  4. Version 1.3
        - Class system for special items: dangerous chemicals, extreme sport tools, powertools, ect.
        - If someone order an item from a special class the system automaticly add description or safety tool to the pack.
        - If the payment is for the video “Learning to Ski,” add a free “First Aid” video to the packing slip (the result of a court decision in 1997).
  5. Version 1.4
        - Communication system between the employees of the company.
        - Communication line between the employees and the developer, to improve the efficiency of the app.
